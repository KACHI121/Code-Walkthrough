# Student Management System

## Overview
This project implements a simple student management system using Python. The system allows users to add, delete, update, and view students. The code follows SOLID principles, eliminates redundancy, and adheres to the DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `student_management.py` file in your Python environment.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the system.

## Changes Made
- Refactored the original code to follow SOLID principles.
- Introduced an abstraction layer (`IStudentRepository`) to decouple the system from the database implementation.
- Simplified the update process by making the `update_student_info` method more straightforward.
- Added a simple text-based menu for user interaction.
